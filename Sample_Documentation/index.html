            <p>An HTML form is a web page element that allows users to input data that is sent to a server for
                processing. Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using
                checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields.

                The <strong>form</strong> tag is used to create an HTML form. The <strong>form</strong> element can
                contain one or more of the following form elements:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><code>input</code>: The most used form element. Can be displayed in many ways, depending on the type
                    attribute.<br></li>
                <li><code>textarea</code>: Used to collect long text input.<br></li>
                <li><code>button</code>: Defines a clickable button to control other elements or execute a
                    functionality.<br></li>
                <li><code>select</code>: Used to create a drop-down list.<br></li>
                <li><code>fieldset</code>: Used to draw a box around other form elements and group the related data.<br>
                </li>
                <li><code>legend</code>: Defines a caption for fieldset elements.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The <strong>form</strong> element has two attributes that are essential for sending data to a server:<br>

                <strong>action</strong>: The URL of the script that will process the form data.<br>
                <strong>method</strong>: The method used to send the form data to the server. The two most common
                methods are GET and POST.
                When a user submits a form, the data entered into the form elements is sent to the server specified in
                the action attribute. The method used to send the data is specified in the method attribute.
            </p>
            <p>HTML forms are a powerful way to collect data from users. They can be used to create a variety of forms,
                such as contact forms, registration forms, and survey forms. Forms can be used to collect data for a
                variety of purposes, such as marketing, customer service, and research.</p>

            <p>HTML graphics are images or other visual elements that are created using HTML code. They can be used to
                add visual interest to a web page, to illustrate a point, or to provide information. There are two main
                types of HTML graphics: inline and embedded.</p>
            <p>Inline graphics are inserted directly into the HTML code. They are typically small images, such as
                company logos or icons. Embedded graphics are stored in a separate file and then linked to the HTML
                code. They can be larger images, such as photographs or illustrations.

            </p>
            <p>There are two main ways to create HTML graphics: using the <strong>img</strong> tag and using the
                <strong>canvas</strong> element. The <strong>img</strong> tag is used to insert an image file into an
                HTML document. The <strong>canvas</strong> element is used to create graphics on the fly, using
                JavaScript.

        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Media">
            <header>HTML Media</header>
            <p> HTML media refers to the use of multimedia elements in HTML pages. Multimedia elements can include
                audio, video, images, and other types of content. HTML media elements allow web developers to embed
                playable media files directly into a web page without having to use Flash or a plug-in.</p>
            <p> The most common HTML media elements are the <strong>audio</strong> and <strong>video</strong> tags. The
                <strong>audio</strong> tag is used to embed audio files, while the <strong>video</strong> tag is used to
                embed video files. Both tags allow you to specify the source file, the controls that should be
                displayed, and other playback options.</p>
            <p>HTML media elements can be used to create a variety of multimedia-rich web pages. For example, you could
                use HTML media elements to create a website that plays music, a website that displays a video tutorial,
                or a website that shows a slideshow of images.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_API">
            <header>HTML API</header>
            <p>HTML APIs are a set of pre-built programs that can be used with the help of JavaScript. They are used to
                implement already written code to fulfill the needs of the project you are working on.

            </p>
            <p>One of the most obvious examples of an HTML API is the DOM (Document Object Model) API. The DOM API
                allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, such as creating, removing, and changing HTML, dynamically
                applying new styles to your page, etc.

            </p>
            <p>There are many other HTML APIs available, such as the Web Storage API, which allows you to store data on
                the web browser, and the Media Capture and Streams API, which allows you to capture and stream media
                content.<br>

                HTML APIs are a powerful tool that can be used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. They are an
                essential part of modern web development.<br>

                Here are some additional details about HTML APIs:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>They are typically used with JavaScript, but they can also be used with other programming
                    languages.<br></li>
                <li>They are available in all major web browsers.<br></li>
                <li>They are constantly being updated with new features and functionality.<br>
                    If you are interested in learning more about HTML APIs, there are many resources available online.
                    You can find tutorials, documentation, and examples of how to use them.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_References">
            <header>HTML References</header>
            <p>HTML references are a way to create links to other elements in an HTML document. They are used to create
                footnotes, citations, and other types of cross-references.</p>
            <p>HTML references are created using the <strong>ref</strong> tag. The <strong>ref</strong> tag has two
                attributes: id and href. The id attribute is the unique identifier for the reference, and the href
                attribute is the URL of the element that the reference points to.</p>
            <p>HTML references are rendered as footnotes by default. However, you can use CSS to style them differently.
                For example, you could style them as citations or as links.<br>

                Here are some additional details about HTML references:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>They are typically used in conjunction with the <strong>a</strong> tag.<br></li>
                <li>They are supported by all major web browsers.<br></li>
                <li>They are a valuable tool for creating accessible and informative web pages.</p>
